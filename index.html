		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>Original email from James on October 8, 2011:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>OK, here's the deal, CK and Jenny were over and we were discussing a "new to most" restaurant club.</p>
			<p>Here are the guidelines:</p>
			<p>A restaurant will be chosen that most of us haven't been to.</p>
			<p>Dinners will take place the last Tuesday of the month, time TBD but usually around 7:00 pm.</p>
			<p>Let the Grand Poo-bah (GPB) (the person who chose the restaurant of the month) know if you will be attending the dinner by time mentioned in the e-mail from the GPB.</p>
			<p>At the dinner, the GPB will pass the torch to the person who will serve as the next GPB.</p>
			<p>Everyone won't be able to make every dinner, and that's OK, we won't hold it against you.</p>
			<p>Here are the details for the first dinner:</p>
			<p>October 25th 7:00 pm</p>
			<p>Dewey's Pizza in Grandview</p>
			<p>Grand Poo-bah is Dr. Megan Norris, RSVP to her by Monday, October 24th @ 11:59 pm EST</p>
			<p>We appreciate your participation, if you wish to unsubscribe, have the balls to hit REPLY ALL and explain your reasoning, and then go SCREW YOURSELF.:P</p>
			<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
